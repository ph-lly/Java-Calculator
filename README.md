My first Java project made at 2:00am. :face_orange_biting_nails: Deal with caution.

TO-DOs:
Handle errors when user enters operators and negation buttons on start of application (no numbers to perform operations on)
Make it so user cannot enter multiple 0s before a decimal point (formatting)
Add background image (commented out block)
Add font
Make code more readable 
By default have 0 in for the textField
Get rid of -0 in display
